## Project Introduction

The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of product sales data to identify trends, customer preferences, and actionable insights for business improvement. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and forecasting.

## Data Preprocessing

In this phase, data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied to ensure data quality and consistency. Missing values are addressed, and the dataset is transformed into a more usable format. Key steps include parsing dates, handling missing data, and deriving additional features such as year, month, day, and weekday.

## Data Visualization using IBM Cognos

Phase 4 focuses on creating interactive dashboards and reports using IBM Cognos. Visualizations are designed to identify sales trends, customer preferences, and other insights. Various chart types are used to present the data effectively, such as line charts for sales trends, column charts for product performance, and area charts for weekday patterns.

## Predicting Future Sales and Revenue

The project includes forecasting future sales and revenue trends. This is done using historical data and forecasting methods available in IBM Cognos Analytics. The goal is to provide insights into expected sales and revenue for the upcoming year, allowing for proactive planning and decision-making.

## Finding Top Selling Product

An analysis is conducted to determine the top-selling product among the available options. This insight is crucial for product focus and marketing strategies.

## Customer Preferences

To understand customer preferences, the project examines monthly sales trends and customer inclinations. The insights derived help in tailoring product offerings and marketing campaigns.

## Sales Trends

This section focuses on identifying sales trends over time, including seasonal patterns and peak sales periods. The analysis helps in planning marketing activities and inventory management.

## Sales on 31st

Estimating sales on December 31st of each year is essential for planning and decision-making, especially when retail centers are closed. Multiple methods are considered to provide an accurate estimate of sales for this date.
